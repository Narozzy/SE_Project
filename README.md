Description
=====================================================================================================
A textbook trading application/website that allows for students to exchange textbooks with one another within their university. The target audience will be students who have already taken a class and no longer needs the textbook they purchased, i.e. an upperclassman. Similarly, the other audience will be students who will need to take a class, i.e. a freshman.The user’s “.edu” email will be utilized to search for the correct forum for their university. A listing will be displayed showing what textbook is being searched for, along the seller/trader’s contact information and message.

Another aspect to the site is the community hub, which serves as a place to host and inform users about events happening in and around your college campus. Users will be able to create information posts which serve mainly as a link to the event to gauge interest/spur discussion, and also be able to host events which will sport features such as polling, discussion, and hierarchy (admin, moderator, user) in order to maintain long-term event pages.


User Stories
=====================================================================================================
They are trying to sell a book for some extra cash after the semester is over, while they are packing to go home, take a picture of their remaining books and offer up a trade for their next semester’s textbooks.
A user wants to schedule a meet up off campus, but taxiing everyone to the event would be a large task for one person, so they want to host a page that allows people to toggle their status of transportation (need a ride, able to pitch in money for a ride share/gas, can offer transportation)
As a user, I want to be able to sort listing results based on class/major
As a user, I want to know that all other users are students and that I will not have to deal with third parties by requiring a student email account in order to access the application
